***Writing at the end of semester*:**

Thanks all who came to my lab this semester. I do hope you can learn sth. from my lab, especially how we think about a problem in a statistical way. I also learned a lot from you like how to better communicate with students. Also, itâ€™s my honor to received a thanks letter from one of you. I really appreciate that and it encourages me a lot. Good luck to your final and thank all of you.
