  If you ask, we can also review some confusing topics from what is listed below:

  - Chapter 1 : sample vs population, sample mean, sample variance, sample standard deviation, shaped of distribution, histogram
  - Chapter 2: sample space, Venn's diagram, events, intersection, union, mutually exclusive, conditional probability, independent event
  - Chapter 2 : principal of counting, permutation, permutation in circle, permutation with identical items, combination, 
  - Chapter 3 : random variable, probability distribution : discrete/continuous, f(x), F(x),
  - Chapter 4: expected value

- Week 7, Mar. 3, NO LAB, NO OH.

  We will grade your exam this week. Hopefully, release it before spring break.

  Also, the OH this week will be ***cancelled*** as well. 
  
  Have a good vacation!
