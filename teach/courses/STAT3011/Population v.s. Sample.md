## Population v.s. Sample



`Def:`  Population is all the observations.

 	      Sample is some observations selected from population.



### Center Limit Theorm (CLT)

If you have a sequence of i.i.d r.v $X_n$, 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\sum X_n}{n} \sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n})
$$



### Standard deviation of different cases

Suppose we have a discrete R.V. $X$ with probability distribution $P(X)$ , mean value $\mu$, SD $\sigma$, 

- Population SD, by definition
  $$
  \sigma=\sqrt{\sum(x-\mu)^{2} P(X=x)}
  $$
  

- Sample SD, n is the number of samples 

- $$
  s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{(n-1)}}
  $$
  
  Example for lab problem 6: $\sqrt{((1-1.5)^2+(2-1.5)^2)/(n-1)}$, where n=2
  
- SD for Sample mean

  By CLT, is $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$

- SD for Sample proportion
  Special case of previous formula.

  $X \sim Bernouli(p)$, $P(X=1)=p$, then $SD_X=\sqrt{p(1-p)}$



### Z-score

$X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, whatâ€™s $P(X>=4)$? 

`Def`: $z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$, evaluates how far a value from mean for a normal distribution.

As for our problem 10, $ Z = \frac{4-3.71}{0.283}$
