## Hypothesis testing for normal.

Notation: Confidence level  $c$ ; Significance level  $\alpha=1-c$ ; Sample size is n

Some comments:

- If we can reject $H_0$ on level $\alpha$, then we can reject it on any higher level. (The reverse is not true.)

- Theorem: (For two-sided test)

  A $c$-level CI includes $\mu_0$ $\Leftrightarrow$ Retain $H_0: \mu=\mu_0$ with $\alpha=1-c$ $\Leftrightarrow p-value>\alpha$

  A $c$-level CI doesn't include $\mu_0 \Leftrightarrow$ Reject $H_0: \mu=\mu_0$ with $\alpha=1-c$ $\Leftrightarrow p-value<\alpha$

- If we have a hopythesis testing with level $\alpha$, then P(Type I error) = $\alpha$.

- The standard error for normal case is $se = \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{n}$, where $\hat{\sigma}^2$ is the sample variance.
