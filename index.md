      Hi, I'm Ganghua Wang. I'm now a first year Statistics Ph.D. student in University of Minnesota. I obtained my BS degree from Peking University.</p> <p class="research"> My research interests mainly lie on statistical learning methods and its applications, such as network analysis and neuroimaging. In both cases, the goal is to discover the hidden structure of the system, which helps better understanding the mechanism of the generating process of data. Challenges such as high dimensionality and weak signals have been posed by large scale data, therefore new techniques need to be proposed. Recent works on Markov Chain Monte Carlo is a promising tool to handle high dimensional situation.  </p>
