      Hi, I'm Ganghua Wang. I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Statistics, University of Minnesota. I obtained my B.S. degree in Statistics in<a href="http://english.math.pku.edu.cn" target="_blank"> the School of Mathematics Sciences</a>, Peking University.</p> 
      <p class="research">My research interests mainly lie in statistical learning methods and their applications, such as network analysis and neuroimaging. Usually, I am motivated by solving practical problems. Recently, I'm thinking about how could we find a model which fits our data best. In other words, how to develop model selection and diagnostic methods. If you're interested in any of the areas and want to talk with me, feel free to email me or drop by my office. Here is my <a href='assets/resource/CV_GW.pdf'>CV</a>.</p>
