> It turns out you can literally fit an elephant with four parameters if you allow the parameters to be complex numbers. See this paper for details: "Drawing an elephant with four complex parameters"[^1].

Some personal comments:

- Actually we use 10 parameters to fit the whole elephant, and we need 12 to make its trunk wiggle.
- The original paper requires access to read. [Here]((https://publications.mpi-cbg.de/getDocument.html?id=ff8080812daff75c012dc1b7bc10000c)) is an alternative version.
- [Fourier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier) strikes again!
- The original speak can be found [here](https://www.kgbreport.com/archives/2014/02/quotes-of-the-day-john-von-neumann.shtml).
